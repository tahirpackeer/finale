        <h2>BENTOTA HATCHERY</h2>

        <p class="para1">
          One of the Sri Lankan turtle hatcheries that has had a significant
          impact on the upbringing of sea turtles is the Kosgoda Turtle
          Hatchery. As we all are aware, poachers and other external factors
          pose a threat to sea turtles in Sri Lanka and across the world. It's
          also a location that informs tourists about the various sea turtles
          and the challenges they encounter at sea. The hatchery was established
          about 40 years ago and is still in operation today. <br /><br />
          Six of the seven species of sea turtles are now in risk of extinction.
          The majority of it results from the exploitation of natural resources
          by humans. Thankfully, this hatchery has accepted responsibility for
          their protection. Beginning with watching over the nesting mother
          turtles, they next transport their eggs to the safe environment of the
          hatchery and, on the day of birth, release the young turtles into the
          sea. If there are problems, they tend to them and only release them
          when they are well enough to enter the huge ocean.<br /><br />
          All five of the country's species may be found making their nests in
          Kosgoda, one of the relatively few hatcheries. They are the Hawksbill,
          Leatherback, Green, and Olive Ridley turtles.

        <h3>How does the hatchery operate?</h3>
        <p class="para2">
          People go out and gather turtle eggs from the sand in the coastal
          areas, which they then sell to the hatchery for money. They wait till
          the eggs have hatched before burying these eggs once more in the sand.
          The hatchlings are then housed in a tank for a few days until they are
          prepared to be released into the sea, where they are fed and cared
          for.
