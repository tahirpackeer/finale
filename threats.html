        Sri Lanka is home to a wide range of species and has an outstanding
        biodiversity throughout its many eco-systems. Marine turtles are among
        these animals that are highly valued since they are rare, old reptiles
        that have lived on the planet for more than 100 million years and have
        developed to the point where they have no natural enemies in the animal
        kingdom and are an essential component of marine eco-systems. However,
        due exclusively to human activity, sea turtles have decreased by 80% in
        the previous 100 years, making them one of the most endangered animals
        in the world.<br /><br /><br />

    <p class="para2">
      Due to increasing pollution in Sri Lanka, where garbage is being thrown
      into the ocean, the health and existence of sea turtles and other marine
      species are under jeopardy. Numerous marine animals, including sea
      turtles, perish each year as a result of ocean pollution and marine debris
      consumption.

        <p class="cardpara1">
          Each year, more than 300 million tonnes of plastic are manufactured,
          of which 10 million tonnes end up in the ocean. Plastic can also
          immediately sink to the ocean floor, become caught in underwater
          avalanches, and mix with silt that is descending into canyons beneath
          the sea. It does not always float on the top. In locations where
          marine life is abundant, plastic that penetrates deep into the ocean
          may become buried in the sediments that make up the bottom.

          <ul>
            <li>
              Reduce. Every plastic item you choose not to purchase reduces the
              amount of plastic that may end up in the ocean. You can encourage
              businesses all across the world to use less plastic packaging if
              you stop purchasing plastic.
            </li>
            <li>
              Don't use single-use plastics. Use a reusable shopping bag rather
              than a plastic one, and choose a paper or reusable straw over a
              plastic one. Be wary of items with concealed plastics, such as tea
              bags, chewing gum, wet wipes, and "paper" cups for takeout coffee.
              Paper cups used for takeout frequently include plastic linings.
            </li>
            <li>
              Don't use microplastic. Microplastics are plastic fragments with a
              length of less than 5 mm. Microplastics have been discovered
              everywhere, from the Mariana trench's lowest point to within both
              people and animals.
            </li>
            <li>
              Recycle. Despite the potential for harm, plastic is nonetheless an
              important resource. Sort your trash instead and send your
              recyclable plastic to a new life because it is not biodegradable.
              It is being reused in this way, which deters the manufacturing of
              more.

    <h3 class="poachersheading">POACHERS</h3>

    <p class="para3">
      Turtles and their eggs have been under growing threat from poachers over
      time, especially during the epidemic when unemployment was rampant.
      Because it allowed individuals to make money from the eggs, poaching
      increased. These eggs are acquired from poachers and kept in Sri Lankan
      turtle hatcheries until the turtles hatch. To get turtles' shells or other
      body parts, they may mistreat or harm them, and they illegally gather
      turtle eggs. This might be sold later on the illicit market.

            <li>
              Reducing demand for turtle goods can be accomplished by raising

              Conservation of habitats - By making it harder for poachers to

              against poaching.
            </li>
            <li>
              Patrols and surveillance - Consistent patrols and surveillance of
              turtle nesting areas and migratory paths can assist to thwart
              poachers and maintain the safety of the turtles.

              Alternate sources of income - Offering communities who depend on

    <p class="para4">
      Due to hotels and other structures being built over turtle hatcheries and
      nesting locations along beaches, hatchlings and turtles have perished. The
      coastal regions where sea turtles lay their eggs are threatened by coastal
      developments because they introduce risks like artificial light and
      pollution.

        <p class="cardpara3">
          Depending on how it is planned and managed, coastal development may
          have both beneficial and bad effects. The following are a few possible
          harmful effects:
        </p>
        <ul class="circlelist4">
          <li>
            Habitat loss - Mangroves, wetlands, and other crucial coastal
            habitats that are essential for many species may be destroyed as a
            result of coastal development.
          </li>
          <li>
            Erosion and sedimentation - Coastal development can change how
            sediment and water naturally flow, which can cause erosion in
            certain regions and sediment deposition in others.
          </li>
          <li>
            Heightened susceptibility to natural disasters - Construction in
            low-lying coastal locations might raise the danger of flooding and
            storm damage.
          </li>
          <li>
            pollutants: Coastal expansion may result in a rise in sewage,
            agricultural, and other types of pollutants that are bad for both
            human health and marine ecosystems.
          </li>
          <li>
            Reduced water quality - Runoff, sewage, and other issues, as well as
            coastal development, can all contribute to worse water quality.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cultural heritage is at risk because coastal development might
            result in the obliteration of key historical and archaeological
            monuments.

        <p class="cardpara4">
          It's not always feasible or desirable to completely stop coastal
          expansion, as there are numerous advantages, like the provision of
          houses and work for people. To lessen the detrimental effects of
          coastal development, however, there are a number of approaches that
          may be taken:
        </p>
        <div class="circlelist5">
          <ul>
            <li>
              Creating coastal management plans: These plans can help with
              coastal development and show where it is not appropriate to build.
              Plans for coastal management can also aid in balancing conflicting
              interests including fishing, tourism, and environmental
              preservation.
            </li>
            <li>
              Critical habitat protection: Development should be prohibited in
              areas that support coral reefs, wetlands, and mangroves. The
              preservation of these ecosystems can help the local communities as
              well as the environment and economy.
            </li>
            <li>
              Zoning laws can be put in place to restrict development in regions
              that are vulnerable to flooding, erosion, or other natural
              disasters. This can aid in lowering the dangers to property and
              human life.
            </li>
            <li>
              Encouragement of sustainable development methods: Green building
              methods, stormwater runoff reduction strategies, and the use of
              renewable energy sources can all assist to reduce the negative
              environmental effects of coastal development.
            </li>
            <li>
              Taking climate change into account: Sea level rise and an increase
              in storm activity are only two of the predicted ways that climate
              change will impact coastal communities. Plans for coastal
              development may take these effects into account to assist assure
              long-term sustainability.
